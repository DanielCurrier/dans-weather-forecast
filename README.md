# Description
This project is a culmination of my understanding of front-end third party apis such as Jquery, Moment.js and Open Weather API by creating a weather forecast application for public and personal use. For more information on how to use it, please refer to the instructions below.
## Installation
n/a
## Instructions
To use this program, please click on the following link: (activated github.io page here). Once you have arrived, go to the search bar in the top left corner and type in your city of residence (or any city) and press enter. This will generate a five day weather forecast using the Open Weather API in conjunction with moment.js. Your searches will be saved in local storage and added to a column on the left side under the search bar. Click on any of these tabs to reopen that city's weather chart. If you would like to remove these searches, click on the "clear search history" button under the search bar.
